# Liquefaction
This is for the journal requirements
This program will help individuals to analyze their data using ANN, PSO, SOM, and anomaly detection at the same time using a hybrid model.
Easily run "runme.mlx" in matlab
You should have a excel file for your input data. Here name is ANN.xlsx
Put all of your data in the columns of excel file. Each row should represent a data in which the last column is the output.
The output file contains all of the steps in the computations. 
There were 25 iterations and the results of each iteration is separated. The name of the output files are: Removedelements.mat and NeuNet.mat
The removed elements shows the removed data from the input database.
NeuNet also shows all of the steps in computations.
